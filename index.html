							<h2>The Cambodian Mindset</h2>
							<p>Imagine living in a shack made of bamboo and palm leaves; one room shared between your parents, your grandparents, yourself and your five siblings. Your youngest brother is three; his favorite toy is a rusty machete. He often swings it around while he runs barefoot along the dirt road. Your oldest brother is the tallest in the family; he is seventeen years old, four foot and eight inches tall.

							<p>Temperatures are always high, but there is no clean drinking water. Even bottled water is infected by poorly sanitized plastic. There is a stream that goes through your village with mango trees lining the bank. Your four year old sister can't reach the fruit on the tree, so she picks one up that has fallen by the water and takes a bite. Over the next few days she develops a dry cough and a sore throat. Over the next few weeks, she is less playful; she seems chronically tired. Today, she is burning up with a fever, but shaking with chills. Her heart is racing and her fingers appear to be purple. The nearest hospital is over an hour away by tuktuk. The hospital is a pediatric hospital, yet they don't have the proper sized instruments to treat children. The pharmacy doesn't have refrigerators to keep medications cool.</p>

								<h2>Polish Goverment Exposed</h2>
								<p>The polish medical student annually spends between 38,000 and 420,000 zloty for 7.5 years of education. However, the highly-trained polish doctor takes home between 16,800 to 18,600 zloty a year, an annual income of roughly 4,600–5,100 USD.</p>

								<p>In recent years, Polish citizens have participated in numerous protests against absurdly low salaries, demanding that a 30% pay raise be implemented for all healthcare professionals.</p>

								<h2>Obamacare, what's that?</h2>
								<p>Obamacare was officially signed into law on March 23rd, 2010 by former President Barack Obama. The law is formally recognized as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or abbreviated as ACA. Obamacare offers a variety of affordable health insurance plans to all American citizens.
									<h3> Bye, Bye Baby! </h3>
									<p> When you turn eighteen, you can finally buy a powerball ticket. At twenty-one, you can trash that poorly made fake ID because you've got the real deal now! At 26...surprise! The law says you can no longer be covered by your parent’s plan. So many milestones and I bet you thought they would all be ones to look forward to! Did you know that you would be getting the gift of no health insurance this year? Plan ahead, don’t be that guy who has to rely on mommy and daddy forever.</p>

							<h2>About the Author</h2>
							<p>Kaleigh Wellhofer is a full-time undergraduate student, pursuing a minor in Professional & Technical Writing in addition to two degrees in Clinical Neuroscience and Psychology, at Virginia Tech. As an active member of Virginia Tech's medical outreach chapter, organized by Volunteers Around the World (VAW), Kaleigh has been fortunate to serve as an avid advocate for providing humanitarian relief in less developed countries. In May of 2017, Kaleigh embarked on her first Medical outreach trip to Siem Reap, Cambodia, where she worked alongside fellow chapter volunteers, local doctors and translators in order to provide medical care to over 600 patients in six days. While in Cambodia, she discovered a natural talent working within the pharmaceutical sector of healthcare. Upon returning to the States, Kaleigh assisted in epilepsy research aimed at finding a generalized AED therapy to treat the one-third of epilepsy sufferers who cannot find relief from current FDA-approved medications. As for the future, Kaleigh plans to continue her education beyond the bachelor-level with hopes of obtaining a masters degree in Healthcare Marketing. Ultimately, Kaleigh plans to embrace her passion for travel and healthcare education by seeking a career as a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative.</p>
